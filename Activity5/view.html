        <p>From mid-August through mid-April, Fairbanks is one of the best places to view the northern lights in Alaska
            due to its location, hours of darkness in the winter, and auroral activity. While the northern lights can be
            seen from anywhere in town, the best opportunities for northern lights viewing happen away from the city's
            ambient light. Join a guided tour to let the locals take you to the best spots for northern lights viewing.
            For a more immersive experience, book a multi-day northern lights package, which will include northern
            lights viewing excursions, meals, and overnight stays at unique, remote lodging options
            specifically-designed for northern lights viewing.

        <p>Likewise, dwellings in the Fairbanks area have been built with the express purpose of aurora viewing in mind.
            Including picturesque lodges and log cabins, remote yurts, well-appointed viewing spaces and posh igloos.
            Many Fairbanks accommodations will give patrons a “wake-up” call when the aurora appears. Also, local
            entrepreneurs have crafted a multitude of exciting ways travelers can simultaneously see the lights and
            enjoy quintessentially Alaskan activities. In our charmed Aurora City you can combine late-night dog
            mushing, snowmachining, ice fishing, flightseeing and more with aurora viewing.
