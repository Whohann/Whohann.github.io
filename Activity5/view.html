        From mid-August through mid-April, Fairbanks is one of the best places
        to view the northern lights in Alaska due to its location, hours of
        darkness in the winter, and auroral activity. While the northern lights
        can be seen from anywhere in town, the best opportunities for northern
        lights viewing happen away from the city's ambient light. Join a guided
        tour to let the locals take you to the best spots for northern lights
        viewing. For a more immersive experience, book a multi-day northern
        lights package, which will include northern lights viewing excursions,
        meals, and overnight stays at unique, remote lodging options
        specifically-designed for northern lights viewing.

        Likewise, dwellings in the Fairbanks area have been built with the
        express purpose of aurora viewing in mind. Including picturesque lodges
        and log cabins, remote yurts, well-appointed viewing spaces and posh
        igloos. Many Fairbanks accommodations will give patrons a “wake-up” call
        when the aurora appears. Also, local entrepreneurs have crafted a
        multitude of exciting ways travelers can simultaneously see the lights
        and enjoy quintessentially Alaskan activities. In our charmed Aurora
        City you can combine late-night dog mushing, snowmachining, ice fishing,
        flightseeing and more with aurora viewing.
