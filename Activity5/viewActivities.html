      <p>
        Fairbanks makes it one of the best places on earth to see the

        do in winter. Skiing, ice skating, snowshoeing, ice fishing, tubing, and
        dog sledding abound. To get out into the backcountry, outfitters offer
        guided snowmobile tours in the Fairbanks area and Chena River State
        Recreation Area.
