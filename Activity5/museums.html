        <h3>University of Alaska Museum of the North</h3>
        <p>The University of Alaska Museum of the North is a must-see attraction for Fairbanks first-timers. The museum
            showcases stories from people and places in Alaska, has award-winning exhibitions, and a souvenir shop
            bursting with special local treats. Be sure to stop by The Place Where You Go To Listen exhibit – a sound
            and light display driven by the real-time position of the moon and sun. The museum is home to the Gallery of
            Alaska, which examines the geology, history, and unusual aspects of each region of the state. Its most
            famous exhibit is Blue Babe, a 36,000-year-old bison found preserved in the permafrost by Fairbanks-area
            miners. In the museum theater, special programs are shown throughout the day, including an amazing
            multimedia presentation on the northern lights.
