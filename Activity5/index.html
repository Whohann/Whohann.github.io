        <h3>About Fairbanks</h3>

        <p>Alaska is one of the best places on earth to see the northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis
            colorful bands of light that dance in the dark night sky. Travelers from all over the world come to Alaska
            to see this stunning display and take advantage of other winter experiences like snowmobiling, dog mushing,
            skiing, festivals, and sporting events.
        </p>
        <p>At 65 degrees north latitude, Fairbanks is renowned for the northern lights, also known as the aurora
            borealis, the midnight sun, and sunsets and sunrises that last forever. Basecamp to Denali National Park &
            Preserve,
            the Interior, and the Arctic — Fairbanks is the Golden Heart of Alaska. Home to just over 100,000 hearty
            souls,
            the Fairbanks region is the second-largest population center in Alaska.
        </p>
        <p>Locals embrace the natural world and have created a vibrant river city in the far north. Where else can you
            travel to such a remote locale and still enjoy all the amenities of a charming downtown, a thriving arts
            community, rich Alaska Native culture, authentic Alaska activities and attractions, and endless
            opportunities
            for exploration?

        <h3>The Science</h3>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>So, what are the northern lights, exactly? The northern lights, also known as aurora borealis, occur about 60
            or 70 miles above the earth’s surface about 10 times higher than a jet aircraft flies and can extend
            hundreds of miles into space. Electrically charged particles traveling through the earth’s magnetosphere
            collide with gasses, creating energy in the form of light. The intensity of solar flares varies the
            intensity and extent of activity within the Auroral oval, the ring-like area above the geomagnetic north
            where auroral activity is concentrated. The most common color displayed is a brilliant green, but the aurora
            borealis can also produce red and purple patterns.

            <h2>Best Time to Visit Fairbanks</h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>If you’re looking for daylight and warm temps, the best time to visit is June through August, when summer is
            in full swing. Temperatures can get up into the 80s and it doesn’t get completely dark for 70 days straight,
            from May 17 – July 27. Keep in mind that July to August is peak visitor season in the city and accommodation
            prices can be more expensive.

            For a less busy and more affordable visit, the shoulder seasons are equally great in Fairbanks. Fall brings
            crisp and bright days with temperatures falling to the 40s, and seeing the changing colors is well worth the
            extra layers. The cooler weather makes hiking more comfortable, and the darker skies mark the start of the
            northern lights viewing season.

            The winter months from December to March are the peak times to see the northern lights. The days can get as
            cold as -30 degrees and snowfall can be heavy. Accommodation prices increase slightly in winter due to the
            influx of northern lights seekers and the many winter festivals that the city hosts, but they typically
            don’t exceed the prices for summer.
